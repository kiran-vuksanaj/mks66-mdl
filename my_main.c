/*========== my_main.c ==========

  This is the only file you need to modify in order
  to get a working mdl project (for now).

  my_main.c will serve as the interpreter for mdl.
  When an mdl script goes through a lexer and parser,
  the resulting operations will be in the array op[].

  Your job is to go through each entry in op and perform
  the required action from the list below:

  push: push a new origin matrix onto the origin stack

  pop: remove the top matrix on the origin stack

  move/scale/rotate: create a transformation matrix
                     based on the provided values, then
                     multiply the current top of the
                     origins stack by it.

  box/sphere/torus: create a solid object based on the
                    provided values. Store that in a
                    temporary matrix, multiply it by the
                    current top of the origins stack, then
                    call draw_polygons.

  line: create a line based on the provided values. Store
        that in a temporary matrix, multiply it by the
        current top of the origins stack, then call draw_lines.

  save: call save_extension with the provided filename

  display: view the screen
